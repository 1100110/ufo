Scripts for building executables and dynamic libraries that are put in ../bin and later distributed with the project

There is no strict organization here. Start by going to the $OS folder described in ../bin/README, and then find the

appropriate .sh, .cmd, etc. script to build. For some projects patches are provided.

Note:
	Most scripts expect that the projects being compiled are the same directory level of this one, and concrete names are expected, such as:

		- luajit (../../luajit from here)
		- glfw   (../../glfw from here)
		- libzmq (../../libzmq from here)
		- AntTweakBar (../../AntTweakbar from here)
