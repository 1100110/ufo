Executable and dynamic libraries organization:

	bin/$OS/$ARCH/...

$OS can be:
	- Windows
	- OSX
	- iOS
	- Linux

and $ARCH:
	- x86 (32-bit i386)
	- x64 (64-bit amd64)
	- arm (armv6, armv7)

Note:
	For OSX, and iOS universal binaries might be used, binaries are just stored in bin/OSX or bin/iOS

Note:
	The OS, and ARCH values are taken directly by luajit's ffi.os, and ffi.arch, with one exception: iOS
