This build LuaJIT using the Windows WDK (Windows Developer Kit)

It assumes certain paths, for example that WDK is in d:\wdk, and that luajit is at the same root level of ufo (and named just luajit)

TODO: Make it more independent, and provide compiling using other means - mingw, VCExpress, WSDK, etc.
