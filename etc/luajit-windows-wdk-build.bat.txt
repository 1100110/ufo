c:\p\ufo\etc> luajit-windows-wdk-build
same as:
c:\p\ufo\etc> luajit-windows-wdk-build 32

c:\p\ufo\etc> luajit-windows-wdk-build 64

This build LuaJIT using the Windows WDK (Windows Developer Kit)
It assumes certain paths, for example that WDK is in d:\wdk, and that luajit is at the same root level of ufo (and named just luajit)

"git log -1" is executed on the luajit depot, and appened to luajit32.exe, luajit64.exe, bin\luajit32.dll, bin\luajit64.dll

TODO: Make it more independent, and provide compiling using other means - mingw, VCExpress, WSDK, etc.
